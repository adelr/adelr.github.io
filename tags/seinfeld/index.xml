      <description>Same difference.
Congratulations! Your simulation code from the previous post has impressed all and sundry and you&#39;ve been asked to teach introductory statistics to first year students at the prestigious Vandelay University. You&#39;ve got 2 stats classes, one with a group of 65 students, and another with a group of 35 students. We assume that the students have been randomly allocated to each group, and that they share the same final exam.</description>

      <description>In this post I want to take a look at a classic data set: the US baby names.
While the origin of many names can be found in popular culture and (what&#39;s the alternative to popular culture? impopular culture?) elsewhere, we shall focus on how the TV show Seinfeld may have influenced the naming of hundreds of innocent babies.
We&#39;ll roughly follow the steps outlined by Wes McKinney in his excellent book Python for Data Analysis to load the data.</description>
